    Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation and transcription, establishing it as a promising target for cancer therapy. Although the covalent inhibitor THZ1 effectively targets CDK7, it presents risks such as short half-life and potential off-target side effects. To address these limitations, we employed a computational workflow integrating virtual screening, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and free energy perturbation (FEP) method to design non-covalent CDK7 inhibitors with enhanced selectivity and safety profiles. MD simulations elucidated THZ1â€™s inhibitory mechanism and identified key molecular fragments within its structure. By incorporating fragments from known inhibitors, we introduced extensive non-covalent interactions within the binding pocket, leading to the identification of three novel non-covalent inhibitors with binding affinities comparable to or higher than that of THZ1. Our findings not only introduce promising CDK7 inhibitors but also present a robust computational framework that could accelerate the discovery of kinase-targeted therapeutics.
