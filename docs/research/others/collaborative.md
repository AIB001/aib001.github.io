# THZ1 Nano-Drug Delivery

I collaborated with Lianxue Zhang from Institute of Quantitative Biology (IQBM), Zhejiang University in doing wet lab research about nano-drug delivery. 

The IQBM research group has presently equipped with various facilities:

- Particle Size Analyzer
- Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Instrument
- Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorter (FACS)
- Ultraviolet (UV) Spectroscopy
- High-Magnification Inverted Fluorescence Microscope
- Intercellular Space
- Organic Synthesis Laboratory
- Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) Instrument

Welcome join ZJU-IQBM lab!
